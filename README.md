# Tailwind CSS Production Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply in a production build, while working correctly in development.  The issue seems unrelated to obvious configuration errors or syntax problems.

## Bug Description

Tailwind classes are applied correctly in the development environment, but they disappear entirely in the production build, leaving elements unstyled. There are no errors in the browser's developer console.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the production version.
4. Open `index.html` (the production build). Observe that Tailwind classes are not applied.
5. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server. Observe that Tailwind classes are applied correctly.

## Potential Causes

* **Build process issues:** The production build process may be failing to correctly include or process the Tailwind CSS output.
* **Caching issues:** Browser caching might be interfering with the application of Tailwind classes. 
* **Configuration errors:** While seemingly correct, there might be a subtle misconfiguration that only manifests in production.
* **Plugin Conflicts:** A potential conflict with another plugin or library might be causing this problem in the production build. 

## Solution

The solution involves checking the build process, purging unused CSS, and verifying Tailwind's configuration.  Please refer to `solution.html` for a possible fix.
