I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though I was using the correct class names and the Tailwind configuration seemed fine.  The issue only manifested in production, not in development. The browser's developer console showed no errors related to Tailwind or my CSS.
