The issue was resolved by ensuring that the production build process correctly included the `tailwind.css` file and that purge was configured properly in the `tailwind.config.js`.  I also cleared my browser cache to ensure that there were no lingering conflicts.

In this corrected `solution.html`, you'll find a correctly configured and functioning implementation of Tailwind classes, demonstrating that it does apply in the production context.

Note that purging unused CSS is crucial for production builds to avoid unnecessary file size.  Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` is configured correctly to purge CSS only the used components.
